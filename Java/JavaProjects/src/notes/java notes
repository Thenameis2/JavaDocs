// used to make comments 
Multi- line comments start with /* and ends with */
primivites are places to hold data 
integer types are byte,short,int, and long
boolean is true or fales (1 or 0)
Arrays hold elements of a type and allow you to define a grouping of primitives or objects(refrences) with the same name
arrays in java are objects 
to create an array, yoh stste the type followed by square brackets and a name == int[] myIntArray;
to initialzie an array we use the new operator another set of squre brackts 
to find the lengeth of the array =  int x = myIntArray.length;
when using floats you have to tell the computer it is a float ex. float e = 2.7685493f, it can be F or f
objects are the 9th primitive type
acess modifer public or private, 
key word = void
